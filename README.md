# Supply-Chain-and-Frighted-Analysis-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive Supply Chain and Freight Analytics dashboard that provides critical insights into logistics performance and financial health. This project features:

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Monitors new customers, Year to Date (YTD) sales, and customer retention rates, offering a clear view of business growth and customer loyalty.
- **Financial Analysis**: Visualizes income vs. expense trends and breaks down expenses by driver, enabling precise financial tracking and cost management.
- **Geographical Insights**: Maps freight logistics routes to optimize international shipping, ensuring efficient route planning and reduced transit times.
- **Expense Tracking**: Categorizes expenses such as Fuel, Insurance, and Travel, providing detailed cost management and helping identify areas for cost reduction.

This dashboard enhances decision-making and operational efficiency through detailed data analysis and visualization, ultimately supporting strategic planning and performance improvement in supply chain operations.
